## The App
This application is a basic implementation of a machine learning system

The program gets 3 integer input (either as inputs or as arguments):
* Set [MNIST, CIFAR-10, Cyst, Not-MNIST]
* Network [CNN, AlexNet]
* Configuration (4 choices, made by me, TBD)

The program will output:
* the accuracy level it has reached
* Cost/Loss plot
